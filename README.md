# WeMosD1miniChristmasOrnament
A complete guide on how to prepare, solder, code and have fun with a self made christmas ornament.

# Soldering the ornament

# Getting started with the code
## Install the Driver
I included the current driver for windows within this repository. You can install it right out of the box. If you prefer to load it from the official wemos site, or simply want a newer version (or one for OSX), please follow [this link](https://wiki.wemos.cc/downloads).

## Installing the board in the Arduino IDE
The following [intro](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager) is copied from the [ESP8266 Arduino github Repo](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino).

### Installing with Boards Manager
1. Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8.7 level or later. The current version is on the Arduino website.
2. Start Arduino and open the Preferences window.
3. Enter https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into the Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
4. Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 platform (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation).
